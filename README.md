# tw2-poa

This is a plan of action checklist for people to follow through while I build the next version of TillWhen.

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

## Running

Open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser
